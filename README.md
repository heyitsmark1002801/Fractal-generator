This project allows you to visualize and explore various fractals generated using L-systems (Lindenmayer systems). You can adjust parameters such as iterations, angles, segment lengths, line widths, and color schemes to create unique and captivating fractal patterns. The application also features a random fractal generator for discovering new and interesting designs.

## Features

- **Visualize Various L-System Fractals**: Choose from popular fractals like the Koch Snowflake, Sierpinski Triangle, Dragon Curve, Fractal Tree, Hilbert Curve, Gosper Curve, and Barnsley Fern.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Customize iterations, angles, segment lengths, line widths, and color schemes to modify the fractal appearance.
- **Random Fractal Generation**: Generate fractals with randomized parameters, including known fractal numbers for classic patterns.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive GUI built with Tkinter for easy control and visualization.
